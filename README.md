Help people in censored locations safely access the internet by operating a [Snowflake proxy](https://snowflake.torproject.org/).
If you need to access the internet, [download Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/). Do not operate a proxy, since that could enable entrance into a monitored network.
